# Beginner Programming Tutorial in Python

## Requirements

***Python 3***

[Python Download](https://www.python.org/downloads/)


***Python IDE/Editor***

I recommend using Pycharm Community Edition to work through the tutorial, but any IDE that supports Python is OK.

## Instructions

Download the files.

Open and complete in the number order.

Try to find the TODO comments in each file before running the files.

To run use your IDE, or type into a console the following:

`python start.py`

## Who this is for

I made this to try to teach someone the basic concepts of programming as the very first time touching programming. I'm hoping this can be useful for anyone at the very first stages of programming.

## Why Python

The language is very close to the english language, so it should be a good place to start for nearly anyone interested in programming.
