# 4 For loops

letter_str = ''

# For loop
for x in range(1):
    letter_str = letter_str + 'k'

# TODO try to get 5 k letters by changing range in the for looop


# These are some example of what range(9) is doing under the hood
# range = [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8] almost the same as range(9)
#TODO try using [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8] instead of range(9)
# when finished return it to range()


##This is what we would need without using a for loop
# letter_str = ''
# letter_str = letter_str + 'k'
# letter_str = letter_str + 'k'
# letter_str = letter_str + 'k'
# letter_str = letter_str + 'k'
# TODO uncomment the above lines to see it work


# !!!! Do not modify below code !!!!
print(letter_str)
