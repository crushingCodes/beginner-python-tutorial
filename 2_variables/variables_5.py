# 2 Variables

# Variables can be useful to save a value for later

# When ever there is a name on the left, and single "=" sign, and something on the right,
# python will try to save the result in the variable

# variable = 'value'
variable = 'You have won $'
print(variable)


# TODO 1. change the variable name to something better matching


# TODO 2. try to use your variable to say the following without changing the code above:
# You have won $100.00
