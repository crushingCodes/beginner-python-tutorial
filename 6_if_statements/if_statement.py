# 6. Conditionals - If statements


# Boolean

# A boolean is another data type, but its mostly used with If statements.
# A boolean is a way to represent True or False
# It can only be True or False


# We can compare to two values to check if they are the same using ==
# TODO run this to see the result
result = 'cat' == 'dog'
print(result)

# TODO run this to see the result
# result = 'dog' == 'dog'
# print(result)




# TODO run this to see which one prints
# active = False
#
# if active:
#     print("Active")
# else:
#     print("Inactive")


# TODO try to print Active by changing one value
